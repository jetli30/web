<h2>Tailwind</h2>
<p>Her third ability is called tailwind and it basically makes her jump forward, left, right, or backwards, depends on whichever direction the player clicks. This ability can be used to dash towards areas quickly, but it is usually used to recover to a safer angle after peeking. The player starts out with a tailwind for free every round and the player gets maximum one tailwind per round. </p>
