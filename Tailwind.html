<h2>Tailwind</h2>
p>Her third ability is called tailwind and it basically makes her jump forward, left, right, or backwards, depends on whichever direction the player clicks. This ability can be used to dash towards areas quickly, but it is usually used to recover to a safer angle after peeking. This ability allows the player to peek aggressively because she can dash away and disengage from the fight whenever the player decides to. This ability also makes Jett an amazing agent for aggressive peeking with the operator sniper on defense. THe player can peek near the entrance of the site with the scope, get a free kill at the start of the round when a player peeks, and then she can dash back into site, playing a more normal angle. This ability also allows players to make aggressive plays such as dashing at a player who is using their abilities and will not expect the sudden attack. The player starts out with a tailwind for free every round and the player gets maximum one tailwind per round. </p>
