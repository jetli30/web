<p> Here is a bar graph made from the word frequencies. 
To get this graph, I first read in a piece of text into 
thonny. Then, I used the list of ten common words and
compared them to the piece of text using a counter and 
for loops. After that, I used this list of the frequencies
along with the list of common words to make a bar graph.

<p> You can see that "and" is used very frequently in the 
article whereas "how" and "why" are not. </p>
