<p> Here is a bar graph made from the word frequencies. 
To get this graph, I first read in a piece of text into 
thonny. Then, I used the list of ten common words and
compared them to the piece of text using a counter and 
for loops. After that, I used this list of the frequencies
along with the list of common words to make a bar graph.</p>

<p> Here is a polygon constructed from word frequencies. 
To get this polygon, I first calculated the average of the
word frequencies. Then, using this number, I calculated the sum of 
the internal angles of the shape and then divided this by the number
of angles to find the measure of each individual angle. Now, I 
could use turtle to construct a regular polygon since I knew how many 
sides the shape will have and the measure of each angle. </p>
