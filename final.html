<p> Here is a bar graph made from the word frequencies. To get this graph, I first 
read in a piece of text into thonny. Then, I used the list of ten common words and
compared them to the piece of text using a counter and for loops. After that, I used
this list of the frequencies along with the list of common words to make a bar graph.</p>

<p> Here is a polygon constructed from word frequencies. To get this polygon, I first
calculated the average of the word frequencies. Then, using this number, I calculated
the sum of the internal angles of the shape and then divided this by the number of angles
to find the measure of each individual angle. Now, I could use turtle to construct a regular
polygon since I knew how many sides the shape will have and the measure of each angle. </p>
