<p> Hello. My name is Jet Li. I am in period 9 and here is the webpage for my final project. Enjoy! </p>
	
<p> This website is designed to determine the frequency of which ten common words appear within an article about the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. 
Using this frequency, a bar graph is made to emphasize how many times these common words appear inside that text. Moreover, a 
drawing is made using the average frequencies of the words and turtle to make a polygon. The number of sides and angles this regular 
polygon has is determined by the average frequencies. With all of these side by side, one can truly see an approximation of how frequent 
common words are in everyday life. </p>
