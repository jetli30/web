<h2>Bladestorm</h2>
<p>Her fourth ability, her ultimate, is called bladestorm. The player requires 6 ultimate points to be able to use this ultimate. Once activated, if the player left clicks, she throws knives one by one, until she throws all five of them. If the player right clicks, she throws all five knives at once. If the player gets a kill using these knives, the player gets reset back to 5 knives for each kill. This ability is sometimes used in conjunction with updraft and tailwind to skillfully attack the opponent. The amazing part about this ultimate is that it is completely accurate at any range and at any range of motion. This allows players to jump, run sideways, and go for midair knife shots while accurately shooting knives and not having to worry about RNG like a player would with a normal gun.</p>
