<h2>Cloudburst</h2>
<p>Her first ability is called cloudburst and she sends out a smoke that lasts for 7 seconds. She can have maximum three of them and they each cost 100 creds. These smokes can be curved or just thrown straight ahead. This ability can be used to smoke off entrances to site on defense or to cover up common angles for a short period of time on offense. Her ability to cover up common angles makes her a both a temporary smoker in the team and also an entry fragger, which is usually the agent that is the first to enter the site and clear up angles while going for kills on the defenders. Her smokes also allow interesting gameplay, as she can hide inside of these smokes, wait for an enemy to walk through, or defuse the spike while the smoke covers her up.  </p>
