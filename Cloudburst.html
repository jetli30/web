<h2>Cloudburst</h2>
<p>Her first ability is called cloudburst and she sends out a smoke that lasts for 7 seconds. She can have maximum three of them and they each cost 100 creds. These smokes can be curved or just thrown straight ahead. This ability can be used to smoke off entrances to site on defense or to cover up common angles for a short period of time on offense.  </p>
